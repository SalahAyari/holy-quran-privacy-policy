# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 27/02/2026

This application provides access to Qur’an reading content and related features. The app is designed to function primarily offline, with certain features available during specific religious periods.

## 1. Information We Collect

The application does not require user registration and does not collect personal information such as name, email address, or phone number.

However, the following anonymous technical data may be collected:

- Start and end dates of a completed khatma (full Qur’an reading)
- Anonymous technical identifier generated by Firebase
- Device information (device model, operating system version)
- Crash and diagnostic reports

This information does not allow us to personally identify any user.

## 2. How We Use the Information

The collected data is used solely to:

- Anonymously count completed khatmas during specific religious periods
- Improve application stability and performance
- Send general religious event notifications
- Fix technical issues and application errors

## 3. Notifications

The application uses Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send general notifications related to religious events or milestones.

An anonymous technical identifier may be generated to enable the delivery of these notifications.

## 4. Third-Party Services

This application uses the following third-party services:

- **Firebase (Google)** for secure storage of anonymous data
- **Firebase Crashlytics** for crash reporting and diagnostics
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging** for push notifications

These services may collect technical information in accordance with their own privacy policies.

## 5. Offline Functionality

The application can function offline for Qur’an reading.

Some assets, including images and audio files, are delivered via Play Asset Delivery or secure remote servers.

## 6. Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share any data for advertising or commercial purposes.

Data is only processed by technical service providers necessary for the functioning of the application.

## 7. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the technical data processed by the application using secure infrastructure provided by Google Firebase.
